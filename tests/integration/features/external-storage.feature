  Scenario: Share by link a file inside a local external storage
    Given user "user0" has been created
    And user "user1" has been created
    And as an "user0"
    And user "user0" has created a folder "/local_storage/foo"

    And folder "/local_storage/foo" of user "user0" is shared with user "user1"
    And as an "user1"
    When the user creates a share using the API with share settings
      | path | foo |
      | shareType | 3 |

    When user "user0" moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/local_storage/foo1/textfile0.txt"
