    And using new dav path
    And user "user0" has been created
    And file "/davtest.txt"  does not exist for user "user0"
    And as an "user0"

  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available
    When user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "user0" contains "0" elements

  Scenario: Upload a file twice and versions are available
    When user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
    Then user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "user0" contains "1" elements
    And the content length of file "/davtest.txt" with version index "1" for user "user0" in versions folder is "8"

  Scenario: Remove a file
    Given user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
    And user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
    And the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "user0" contains "1" elements
    And user "user0" deletes file "/davtest.txt"
    When user "user0" uploads file "data/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt"
